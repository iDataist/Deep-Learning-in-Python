# Deep Learning in Python

The data analysis is documented in [Deep_Learning_in_Python.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Deep-Learning-in-Python/blob/master/Deep_Learning_in_Python.ipynb). The lecture notes and the raw data files are also stored in the repository. The summary of the content is shown below:

- Basics of deep learning and neural networks

- Optimizing a neural network with backward propagation

- Building deep learning models with keras

- Fine-tuning keras models
